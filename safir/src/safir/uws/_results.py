        Notes

        This uses custom credentials so that it will work with a GKE service
        account without having to export the secret key as a JSON blob and
        manage it as a secret. For more information, see `gcs_signedurl
        <https://github.com/salrashid123/gcs_signedurl>`__.

        This is probably too inefficient, since it gets new signing
        credentials each time it generates a signed URL. Doing better will
        require figuring out the lifetime and refreshing the credentials when
        the lifetime has expired, which in turn will probably require a
        longer-lived object to hold the credentials.
