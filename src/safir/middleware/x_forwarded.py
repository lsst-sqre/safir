class XForwardedMiddleware(BaseHTTPMiddleware):
    """Middleware to update the request based on ``X-Forwarded-For``.

    The remote IP address will be replaced with the right-most IP address in
    ``X-Forwarded-For`` that is not contained within one of the trusted
    proxy networks.

    If ``X-Forwarded-For`` is found and ``X-Forwarded-Proto`` is also present,
    the corresponding entry of ``X-Forwarded-Proto`` is used to replace the
    scheme in the request scope.  If ``X-Forwarded-Proto`` only has one entry
    (ingress-nginx has this behavior), that one entry will become the new
    scheme in the request scope.

    The contents of ``X-Forwarded-Host`` will be stored as ``forwarded_host``
    in the request state if it and ``X-Forwarded-For`` are present.  Normally
    this is not needed since NGINX will pass the original ``Host`` header
    without modification.

    Parameters
    ----------
    proxies
        The networks of the trusted proxies.  If not specified, defaults to
        the empty list, which means only the immediately upstream proxy will
        be trusted.
