### New features

- Add new `strip` argument to the `read_text` and `assert_text_matches` methods of `safir.testing.Data`, and an `add_newline` argument to `write_text`. If set to true, a newline is added to the text when written to the file system and removed on read, so files on disk end in a newline. This is more convenient for editors and programs like `git diff`.
