### Backwards-incompatible changes

- Rewrite the Safir UWS support to use Pydantic models for job parameters. Services built on the Safir UWS library will need to change all job creation dependencies to return Pydantic models.
- Use the Wobbly service rather than a direct database connection to store UWS job information. Services built on the Safir UWS library must now configure a Wobbly URL and will switch to Wobbly's storage instead of their own when updated to this release of Safir.
- Support an execution duration of 0 in the Safir UWS library, mapping it to no limit on the execution duration. Note that this will not be allowed by the default configuration and must be explicitly allowed by an execution duration validation hook.
- Convert all models returned by the Safir UWS library to Pydantic. Services built on the Safir UWS library will have to change the types of validator functions for destruction time and execution duration.
- Safir no longer provides the `safir.uws.ErrorCode` enum or the exception `safir.uws.MultiValuedParameterError`. These values were specific to a SODA service, and different IVOA UWS services use different error codes. The Safir UWS library now takes error code as a string, and each application should define its own set of error codes in accordance with the IVOA standard it is implementing.
