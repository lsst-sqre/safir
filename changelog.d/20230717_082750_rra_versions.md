### Bug fixes

- Safir now pins the major version of all of its non-development dependencies. The impetus for this change is to prevent upgrades to Pydantic 2.x until Safir's Pydantic models are ready for that upgrade, but a similar principle applies to other dependencies. These pins will be selectively relaxed once Safir has been confirmed to work with a new major release.
