### New features

- Allow an application to pass an existing FastStream Kafka broker and aiokafka admin client into `safir.metrics.BaseMetricsConfiguration.make_manager`. This simplifies metrics integration for Kafka applications with existing brokers, without requiring manual manager construction and losing the auto-selection of the no-op and mock event managers.
