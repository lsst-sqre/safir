### Breaking changes

- Change the `manage_kafka` flag to `safir.metrics.KafkaEventManager` to `manage_kafka_broker`. It now only controls whether the Kafka broker is started and stopped. The Kafka admin client is unconditionally managed (started and stopped) by `KafkaEventManager` and should not be shared with any other application use.

### New features

- Allow an application to pass an existing FastStream Kafka broker into `safir.metrics.BaseMetricsConfiguration.make_manager`. This simplifies metrics integration for Kafka applications with existing brokers, without requiring manual manager construction and losing the auto-selection of the no-op and mock event managers.
