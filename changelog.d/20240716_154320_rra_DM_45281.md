### New features

- Add new `safir.pydantic.SecondsDatetime` and `safir.pydantic.HumanDatetime` types for use in Pydantic models. These behave the same as `datetime.timedelta` fields but use custom validation. Both support a stringified number of seconds as input, and the latter also supports the interval strings parsed by `safir.datetime.parse_timedelta`.
