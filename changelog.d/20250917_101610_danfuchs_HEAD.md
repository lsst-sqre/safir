### Other changes

- Starlette deprecated the `HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY` constant and
  changed it to `HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_CONTENT` in [this
  PR](https://github.com/Kludex/starlette/pull/2939). We could either
  change this constant in our code, or just use the status code int
  directly.

  Use status code directly here rather than the new constant in
  to avoid having to increase the lower bound on starlette. This is the
  choice that the FastAPI folks made in [this
  PR](https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/pull/14077/files).
