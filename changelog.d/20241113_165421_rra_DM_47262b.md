### New features

- Add `safir.database.drop_database` utility function to drop all database tables mentioned in a SQLAlchemy ORM schema and delete the Alembic version information if it is present. This is primarily useful for tests.

### Other changes

- Document how to test an application's database schema against its Alembic migrations to ensure that the schema hasn't been modified without adding a corresponding migration.
