### New features

- Add watch, field selector, and label selector support to `list_namespace` in the Kubernetes mock.

### Bug fixes

- `read_namespace` and `list_namespace` in the Kubernetes mock now only return namespace objects that have been explicitly created, not implicit namespaces created by creating another object without making a namespace first. This more closely matches the behavior of Kubernetes while still making it easy to use the mock in a test environment simulating a pre-existing namespace.
