### Backwards-incompatible changes

- Add serializers to `HumanTimedelta` and `SecondsTimedelta` that serialize those Pydantic fields to a float number of seconds instead of ISO 8601 durations. This means those data types now can be round-tripped (serialized and then deserialized to the original value), whereas before they could not be.

### Bug fixes

- `SecondsTimedelta` now correctly validates an input stringified floating-point number of seconds instead of truncating it to an integer.
