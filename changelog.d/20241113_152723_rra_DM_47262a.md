### Backwards-incompatible changes

- `parse_isodatetime` and `normalize_isodatetime` now accept exactly the date formats accepted by the IVOA DALI standard. This means seconds are now required, the trailing `Z` is now optional (times are always interpreted as UTC regardless), and the time is optional and interpreted as 00:00:00 if missing.

### New features

- Add new `safir.pydantic.UtcDatetime` type that is equivalent to `datetime` but coerces all incoming times to timezone-aware UTC. This type should be used instead of using `normalize_datetime` as a validator.
- Add new `safir.pydantic.IvoaIsoDatetime` type that accepts any ISO 8601 date and time that matches the IVOA DALI standard for timestamps. This follows the same rules as `parse_isodatetime` now follows. This type should be used instead of using `normalize_isodatetime` as a validator.
