### Backwards-incompatible changes

- Change `result_id` to `id` in `safir.arq.uws.WorkerResult` to match the fields of `JobResult`. UWS service worker functions will need to make the corresponding change when constructing results.
- Drop `arq_mode` from `safir.arq.uws.WorkerConfig`, since backend workers no longer need to construct an arq queue. This setting can be deleted from UWS worker configurations.
