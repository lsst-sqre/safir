### New features

- `safir.arq` is now available as a separate PyPI package, `safir-arq`, so that it can be installed in environments where the full Safir dependency may be too heavy-weight or conflict with other packages. The `safir[arq]` dependency will continue to work as before (by installing `safir-arq` behind the scenes).
