### New features

- All `delete_*` APIs in the mock Kubernetes API now support `grace_period_seconds` and a `V1DeleteOptions` body. Both are ignored.
- `delete_namespaced_job` in the mock Kubernetes API now requires `propagation_policy` to be passed as a keyword argument if provided, and does not require it be set.
