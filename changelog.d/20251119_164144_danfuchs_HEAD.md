### Bug fixes

- app metrics - Don't raise exceptions when the Schema Manager goes down in the
middle of registering event publishers. If the Schema Manager went away in the
time between when an event publisher was successfully created and an attempt at
creating another event publisher, the app metrics error handling wrapper
incorrectly set the EventManager state to uninitialized, which made other parts
of the event manager throw EventManagerUninitializedErrors. This made it so
that applications using the app metrics functionality were broken until
restart.
