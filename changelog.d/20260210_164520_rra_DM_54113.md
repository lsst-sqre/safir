### Backwards-incompatible changes

- Return simple async sessions instead of SQLAlchemy `async_scoped_session` objects from the `db_session` FastAPI dependency. The behavior should be the same for most callers, namely an async session that is automatically closed at the end of the request, but it has more predictable behavior in situations where a session may be passed between asyncio tasks.
