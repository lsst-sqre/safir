### New features

#### Generic Arq metrics

You can now instrument your [arq](https://github.com/python-arq/arq) jobs to emit an `arq_job_run` app metric with a `queue` tag and a `time_in_queue` field. You can use this to help you decide if and when you need to add more workers.

To enable this, you need to:

* Add app metrics configuration to your app
* Add `queue` to the list of fields in the Sasquatch app metrics configuration
* Create a `safir.metrics.EventManager` and pass it to `safir.metrics.initialize_arq_metrics` in your `WorkerSettings.on_startup` function.
* Generate an `on_job_start` function by passing a queue name to `safir.metrics.make_on_job_start`.
  Make sure you shut this event manager down cleanly in your shutdown function.
