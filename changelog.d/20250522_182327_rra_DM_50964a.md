### New features

- Add `safir.testing.containers.FullKafkaContainer` and `safir.testing.containers.SchemaRegistryContainer` classes based on Testcontainers that create containers for Kafka and the Confluent schema registry, respectively. These classes are intended for use in fixtures or test configuration to enable testing against a local temporary Kafka cluster.
