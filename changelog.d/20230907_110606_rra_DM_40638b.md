### Bug fixes

- Kubernetes objects included in events are now serialized properly using the Kubernetes camel-case field names instead of the Python snake-case names. In addition to matching Kubernetes behavior more closely, this allows a watch configured with the Kubernetes model type to deserialize the object in the `object` key of the event dictionary. The type must be passed explicitly to the `Watch` constructor, since kubernetes_asyncio's type autodetection does not work with Safir's mock.
- `safir.testing.kubernetes.patch_kubernetes` no longer mocks the entire `ApiClient` class since it is required for deserialization of objects in Kubernetes events. It instead mocks the `request` method of that class for safety, to prevent any network requests to Kubernetes clusters when Kubernetes is mocked.
