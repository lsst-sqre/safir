### New features

- `safir.logging` is now available as a separate PyPI package, `safir-logging`, so that it can be installed in environments where the full Safir dependency may be too heavy-weight or conflict with other packages. Packages that do depend on `safir` can and should ignore this change and continue to assume depending on `safir` will be sufficient to provide `safir.logging`.
