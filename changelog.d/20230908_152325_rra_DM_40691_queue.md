### Bug fixes

- When creating a `Pod` from a `Job` in the Kubernetes mock using `generateName`, randomize the `Pod` name like Kubernetes does rather than using a fixed name. This forces tests to scan correctly for pods associated with a job. If the `Pod` `name` or `generateName` was explicitly configured in the `Job` template, honor it.
