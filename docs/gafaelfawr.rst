Requiring Gafaelfawr authentication
###################################

Safir provides two FastAPI dependencies intended for applications designed to run behind a Kubernetes ingress configured to authenticate requests with `Gafaelfawr`_.

Getting the authenticated user
==============================

Gafaelfawr sets the ``X-Auth-Request-User`` HTTP header to the username of the user authenticated with a Gafaelfawr token.
To get that username, use the `~safir.dependencies.gafaelfawr.auth_dependency` FastAPI dependency, as follows:

.. code-block:: python

   from fastapi import Depends

   from safir.dependencies.gafaelfawr import auth_dependency


   @app.get("/route")
   async def get_rounte(user: str = Depends(auth_dependency)) -> Dict[str, str]:
       # Route implementation using user.
       return {"some": "data"}

If the request does not have the Gafaelfawr header set, it will be rejected by FastAPI with a 422 status code.

To safely use this dependency, the application must be configured so that all requests will go through an ingress configured to use Gafaelfawr.
If this is not the case (if, for example, the application is directly exposed to the Internet), the person sending the request could include the header that would be set by Gafaelfawr and assert any identity that they chose, which is obviously insecure.

Including the authenticated user in logging
===========================================

To include the authenticated user in log messages from a handler, use the `~safir.dependencies.gafaelfawr.auth_logger_dependency` dependency instead of the `~safir.dependencies.logger.logger_dependency`.
It works the same way, but additionally binds the ``user`` context variable to the authenticated user, obtained via `~safir.dependencies.gafaelfawr.auth_dependency`.

For more details, see :ref:`logging-in-handlers`.

Testing applications using this dependency
==========================================

When testing an application that uses this dependency, any web requests to the authenticated routes of the application must include the ``X-Auth-Request-User`` header, or the test call will be rejected.
For example (assuming use of ``httpx.AsyncClient`` for testing):

.. code-block:: python

   r = await client.get("/", headers={"X-Auth-Request-User": "someuser"})

The value of the header should be the username of the user the test is simulating.
Optionally, if a test will be simulating many requests from the same authenticated user, this header can be added as a default header sent by the client.
This is most easily done by defining a fixture, as follows.
(This fixture assumes the FastAPI application under test is available via another fixture named ``app``.)

.. code-block:: python

   from typing import AsyncIterator

   import pytest_asyncio
   from fastapi import FastAPI
   from httpx import AsyncClient


   @pytest_asyncio.fixture
   async def client(app: FastAPI) -> AsyncIterator[AsyncClient]:
       base = "https://example.com/"
       hdrs = {"X-Auth-Request-User": "user"}
       async with AsyncClient(app=app, base_url=base, headers=hdrs) as client:
           yield client

Tests can then use ``client`` as a fixture and don't have to provide the ``X-Auth-Request-User`` header with every call.
Individual calls that need to use a different ``X-Auth-Request-User`` header set in that call, and that will override the default set in the ``AsyncClient`` object.
