# safir-logging

safir-logging is a subpackage of Safir, Rubin Observatory's library for building [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) services for the [Phalanx](https://phalanx.lsst.io) Kubernetes clusters, including the Rubin Science Platform and Roundtable.
It is a separate PyPI module so that it can be used as a dependency in contexts where the full Safir dependency is undesirable.

safir-logging is available from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/safir-logging/):

```sh
pip install safir-logging
```

safir-logging is developed and tested in conjunction with Safir.
